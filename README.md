  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started coding when I was studying an IT course at TasTafe in Tasmania.  I learned basic python and how to make websites there, and I quickly became invested in coding there after.  I continued self studing with FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. I would use these resources to learn more and also practice making small projects on here.  I've gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I also have some knowledge of databases.  With time, I expanded my knowledge and explored other technologies.  I regularly use virtual machines to become more familiar with other operating systems like Unix/Linux.  My coding and IT journey has been challenging but also very rewarding.  I will continue to upload my projects on here to document my progress and share what I've learned.  Feel free to get in touch with me on my website below.
